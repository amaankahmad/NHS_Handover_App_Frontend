# NHS_Handover_App

At 8pm the night team of doctors arrive.  Many teams in the hospital have already left by 5pm.  Patients often move from ward to ward and don't have continuity of nursing care.  If a medical job needs doing (eg checking and acting on a blood test) this can rely on verbal handover sometimes along a chain of 2 or more junior doctors.  The person doing the job may not understand the importance or what to do if there is an unexpected event.  This can add up to unintended and potential harmful clinical incidents.

We would like an app-based system whereby handover can be efficiently logged and checked off.  The list can be accessed by the night team, with the night registrar ultimately in charge of ensuring everything has been done by the following morning.
